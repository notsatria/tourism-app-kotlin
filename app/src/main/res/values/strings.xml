    <string name="place_description_dummy">Hidden within the bustling heart of Jakarta lies Ciliwung Lake, a shimmering expanse whispering tales of ancient spirits and forgotten kingdoms. Though shrouded in modern cityscape, the lake\'s soul remains tethered to its mystical past. Legend speaks of a hidden city beneath its surface, a forgotten civilization swallowed by the lake\'s wrath centuries ago. On moonlit nights, some swear they see spectral figures gliding across the water, their whispers carried on the wind.</string>
